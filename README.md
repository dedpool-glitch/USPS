In 2015, The Washington Post began to log every fatal shooting by an on-duty police officer in the United States. In that time there have been more than 5,000 such shootings recorded by The Post.
This was done because they thought the police were not reporting every civilian casualty per year. 
 
I have done an EDA on this dataset.
