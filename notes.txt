Sex differences in crimes:

Gottfredson and Hirschi's (1990) "general theory of crime," which stated that individuals with lower levels of self-control are more likely to be involved in criminal behavior, in a gender-sensitive context. The purpose of their study was to account for the gender gap in crime rates.Statistics have been more than consistent in reporting that males commit way more crimes than their opposite sex.
There are two theories on the role of testosterone in aggression and competition among males.[21] The first one is the Challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behaviour which would include aggression as a result of evolution.[21] Thus it is the challenge of competition in relation to testosterone among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence.[21] Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels.[21]
